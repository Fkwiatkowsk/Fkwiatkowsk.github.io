            <h1>Perogi Recipe</h1>
         <p> The origin of the pierogi is often under debate but the exact origin is unknown. The dish likely orginated somewhere in Central or Eastern Europe <br>
            as the dish was eaten here long before the poltical boreders were put in place. Today the dish is eaten in many Central European Countries but is most <br>
            prominantly found in Poland.</p>

         <p> Pierogi are boiled dumplings with a variety of different fillings. These fillings include potato, cheese, sauerkraut and even friuts. Peirogi are very easy to 
            freeze and eat as a last minute meal.<br>

               <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Filling</b>
                <ul>
                <li>8 baking potatoes (peeled and cubed)</li>
                <li>1 cup shreded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons processed cheese sauce</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together the flour and salt in a large bowl. In a seperate bowl wisk sour cream, eggs, egg yolk, butter and oil. Add the wet ingerdients into the dry ingredients until a well bended dough is formed.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a towel and let it sit for 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Meanwhile prepare the filling: Place the potatoes in a pot and cover them with water. Boil until tender or for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Drain and mash the potatoes and add shreded cheese and cheese sauce </li>
            <li>Add onion salt, salt and pepper to the filling.</li>
            <li>Set aside to cool</li>
            <li>Separate pierogi dough into two balls. Roll out one ball at a time on a lightly floured surface until it is thin enough to work with, but not too thin so that it tears, between 1/8- and 1/4-inch thick. Cut into circles using a cookie cutter, pierogi cutter, or a glass, 3 to 4inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Brush a little water around the edges of the circles, and spoon some filling into the center. Fold the circles over into half-circles, and press to seal the edges with fingers, or use a fork for crimped edges.</li>
            <li>Place perogies on a cookie sheet, and freeze. Once frozen, transfer to freezer storage bags or containers.</li>
            <li>To cook the perogies: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Lower perogies into the water in batches. Cook until they float to the top, about 5 minutes. <u><b>Do not boil too long, or they will be soggy.</b></u> Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
        </ol>
